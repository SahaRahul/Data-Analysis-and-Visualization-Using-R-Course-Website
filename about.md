Getting Started
------------

To start this course, you'll need to

* **Install the newest version of R**, which can be done [here](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/). Make sure you have version 3.0 or greater.
* **Install RStudio**, which can be found [here](http://www.rstudio.com/). While the course covers only the absolute basics of using the software, you can view a [video overview here](http://vimeo.com/97166163) and look into the [detailed documentation here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/categories/200035113-Documentation).

How To Take This Course
------------

This course is divided into four lessons, each of which is divided into 4-8 segments. We combine a few types of material:

* **Videos**: Each segment is associated with a 3-8 minute video tutorial. As you watch the video you should have RStudio open, and follow along with every line of code yourself!
* **Quizzes**: Each segment includes a brief, self-evaluation quiz performed interactively in R, using [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). See [here](../quizzes/) to learn how to install the lessons and take the quizzes.
* **Code**: All the code that is typed in the video is provided along with its output ([example](../code/code_lesson2/))- this can be helpful if you need to quickly look up how a command was performed or get the spelling and syntax correct.

You do not necessarily need to take all four lessons in the suggested order. If you have taken a course on R before, and feel comfortable with concepts such as vectors, data frames, lists, and matrices, you may be able to skip some or all of [Lesson 1](../lessons/lesson1). If you aren't familiar with the ggplot2 package, you'll need to take [Lesson 2](../lessons/lesson2) before Lessons [3](../lessons/lesson3) and [4](../lessons/lesson4), which both assume you're comfortable with it.

About Us
----------

Lessons 2-4, along with the site and quizzes, were developed by [David Robinson](http://dgrtwo.github.io/), a PhD student in [Quantitative and Computational Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/qcbgrad/) at Princeton. Lesson 1's videos were written and recorded by [Neo Christopher Chung](http://www.princeton.edu/~nc/index.html). Videos were filmed and edited by the [Princeton Broadcast Center](http://www.princeton.edu/bc/) in conjunction with the [McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning](http://www.princeton.edu/mcgraw/).
