Here are some resources from outside of this course that will probably be useful
in learning R.

I'm also creating an online course on exploratory data analysis together with [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), an interactive platform to [learn R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) and data science.

### Basic Tutorials

* [Try R](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r): an free interactive in-browser tutorial

* [Twotorials](http://www.twotorials.com/): a series of two-minute videos introducing R

* [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)

* [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/)

* [R Reference Card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)

### Advanced

* [ggplot2 docs](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) Documentation and detailed examples of all ggplot2 functions

* [Introduction to the data.table package in R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.pdf):
a tutorial that goes far beyond the discussion of data.table in [Lesson 4](../lessons/lesson4).

### Expert

* [Tidy Data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/): An excellent paper that lays out an essential guide to shaping your data to make manipulation, analysis and visualization easy

* [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf): an amusing guide to some of R's more surprising traps.

* [10 R Packages I Wish I Knew About Earlier](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/10-R-packages-I-wish-I-knew-about-earlier.html)

* [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) A tutorial to writing and publishing your own R packages

* [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/): An R package for producing reproducible reports that integrate R with LaTeX or markdown.

* [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) Easily create interactive web visualizations using R

* [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/): A repository of R packages for analyzing genomic data, including genome sequencing and expression analysis.
